# 1 - a function that prints the binary representation of a number
# 2 -  function that returns the value of a bit at a given index
# 3 - function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.
# 4 - function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.
# 5 - function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another
# 6 -  a function that checks the endianness.
